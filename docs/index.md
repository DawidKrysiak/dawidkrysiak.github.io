This page is a set of notes on the broad subject of 'sysadmin work'.

My 'computer guy career' started as a filthy pirate at the late '80s (Arrrrrr), 6502 coder, then slowly moved to helping companies with DOS, Windows 3.x and first attempts to LAN creation and management. Over time, full-on Windows 9x, NT administration, sizeable LAN creation. Then Linux came about and my world just exploded. 

At this point, I don't even know what I know. People just ask me questions (all the time :)) and I just blurt out answers I didn't know I have. Maybe it's time to write some of those down?

I will try to fill in the tree [git mind tree I created a few years ago](https://gitmind.com/app/docs/mal7wcyw) wherever possible.

There WILL be a lot of ambiguities and overlaps (e.g networking tools could be considered a 'terminal skill' or 'networking skill' or 'Linux skill' depending which way you want to look at it).

In many sections, you'll find a copy/paste solution to a real-world problem I had to resolve, or just barely-coherent notes that I used to prepare myself for certification.
