## Amazon EMR  
#### Amazon EMR makes it simple and cost effective to run highly distributed processing frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, and Presto when compared to on-premises deployments. Amazon EMR is flexible â€“ you can run custom applications and code, and define specific compute, memory, storage, and application parameters to optimize your analytic requirements.  
  
### Buzzwords and other big-data nonsense  
* **Hadoop** Apache Hadoop is a distributed system to solve problems involving massive ammounts of data and computation. Software framework for distributed storage and processing of **big data**  
* **HDFS** a distributed filesystem that stores data on commodity machines, providing very aggregate bandwidth across the cluster  
* **Hadoop YARN** platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them for **scheduling users' applications **  
* **Hadoop MapReduce** an implementation of the MapReduce programming model for large-scale data processing  
* **Hadoop Ozone** an object store for Hadoop  
* **SQL queries**  
* Amazon EMR giver you full control over the configuration your cluster and software installed on it (so YARN?)
