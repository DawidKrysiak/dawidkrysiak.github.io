* analysis of semi-structured data and structured data stored in Amazon S3 (e.g. CSV, JSON, Apache Parquet, Apache ORC - columnar data formats)
* ad-hoc queries using ANSI SQL without the need to aggregate or load data into Athena


## Integrations
* Amazon QuickSight for visualisation
* Amazon Glue Data Catalog which offers persistent metadata store for your data in Amazon S3, create tables and query data in Athena based on central metadata store and integrated with ETL and data discovery features of AWS Glue.
