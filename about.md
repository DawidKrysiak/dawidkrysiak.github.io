This page exists as I don't like how GitHub pages treat web spiders (simply stating: searchability of github pages is horrible). It also serves as a sandbox for me, to learn new (to me) technologies.

Privacy statement:
I don't care who you are, where you came from. I don't care about your browser history or social media links. This page is not and will not spy on you or use your data to bust its ranking. If you find any of the posts useful - link it, share it, that's the only way this page will promote itself (it's not made for profit).
